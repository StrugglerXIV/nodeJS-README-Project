# Node JS README generator

## Description
In this project we were supposed to create a code that runs in the terminal using NODEJS. In this code a series of questions will be asked based on the guide to create a professional readme provided at the beginning of this class. Using the lessons of JK and Roland along with google I was able to create something that should be able to meet the acceptance criteria of the course.
